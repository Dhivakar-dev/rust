# Rust Learning Repository

This repository contains code examples and exercises from the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## About

This is a personal learning project where I'm working through the official Rust programming language book to understand Rust concepts, best practices, and how to write safe and efficient Rust code.

## Structure

- `src/` - Source code for learning projects and examples
- `Cargo.toml` - Project manifest and dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts

### Running Code

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the project
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code without building
cargo check
```

## Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Official documentation
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code

## Progress

Following chapters from the Rust book and implementing examples and exercises as I learn.

**Note:** This repository is for educational purposes and contains practice code from learning the Rust language.
